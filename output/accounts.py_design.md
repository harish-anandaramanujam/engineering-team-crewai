# `accounts.py` Module Design

## Overview

The `accounts.py` module houses a comprehensive account management system intended for a trading simulation platform. It allows users to perform financial transactions such as depositing, withdrawing, and trading shares. It keeps track of transactions and provides financial insights such as total portfolio value, profit/loss, and transaction history. It also ensures transactional constraints are adhered to, like not overdrafting accounts or trading invalid share quantities.

## Classes and Methods

### Class: `Account`

The `Account` class models an individual user's account in the trading simulation platform, handling all functionalities related to funds and trading management.

#### Attributes:

- `account_id`: Unique identifier for the account.
- `balance`: Current liquid balance in the account.
- `initial_deposit`: The initial amount deposited to the account.
- `transactions`: A list that stores all transaction records as tuples `(date, type, details, amount)`.
- `holdings`: A dictionary to store shares owned, with the symbol as the key and quantity as the value.

#### Methods:

- `__init__(self, account_id: str, initial_deposit: float)`: Initializes the account with a unique `account_id` and an `initial_deposit` which sets the starting balance and logs this deposit.

- `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`: Adds funds to the account and records the transaction. Raises an exception if the amount is negative.

- `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> None`: Deducts funds from the account, ensuring the balance does not become negative. Raises an exception if the amount is greater than available balance.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> None`: Records the purchase of shares if enough funds are available in the balance. Calculates the total purchase price using `get_share_price(symbol)` and updates holdings.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> None`: Records the sale of shares if the user owns the specified quantity. Updates holdings and adds proceeds to the balance.

- `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`: Calculates and returns the current total portfolio value, combining current balance and value of holdings based on current share prices.

- `get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`: Calculates and returns the net profit or loss compared to the initial deposit by comparing the current portfolio value and initial deposit.

- `get_holdings(self) -> dict`: Returns a snapshot of current shares held by the user.

- `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`: Returns a list of all transactions made by the user.

- `can_afford_transaction(self, cost: float) -> bool`: Helper method to check if a transaction can be afforded.

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`: Static method providing current price for a share, built atop the pre-defined method for fetching share prices.

### Test Setup - Function Simulation

We'll provide a mock implementation of the `get_share_price` function to support the testing of `Account` functionalities. It will return fixed prices for symbols 'AAPL', 'TSLA', and 'GOOGL'.

```python
def get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float:
    prices = {
        'AAPL': 150.0,
        'TSLA': 600.0,
        'GOOGL': 2800.0,
    }
    return prices.get(symbol.upper(), 0.0)
```

This module will deliver all necessary functionalities for account management in the trading simulation platform. It integrates mock share price functionality to facilitate comprehensive testing and simulation of trading scenarios in the absence of real-time market data.
